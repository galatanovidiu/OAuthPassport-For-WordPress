Transform your WordPress site into a secure OAuth 2.1 authorization server. Enable third-party applications to authenticate users and access your APIs.

== Description ==

OAuth Passport transforms your WordPress site into a **secure OAuth 2.1 authorization server**. It enables external applications to authenticate users and access your WordPress resources through standards-compliant OAuth flows.

Perfect for developers building mobile apps, desktop applications, or integrating with third-party services.

= Key Features =

* **OAuth 2.1 Compliant** - Full implementation with mandatory PKCE support
* **Dynamic Client Registration** - Self-service client registration (RFC 7591)
* **React Admin Interface** - Modern admin panel for managing clients and tokens
* **Discovery Endpoints** - Automatic configuration discovery for easy integration
* **WordPress Integration** - Seamless integration with WordPress user system
* **Secure by Default** - HTTPS enforcement, token rotation, and rate limiting

= Use Cases =

* **Mobile Apps** - Authenticate users in iOS/Android applications
* **Desktop Applications** - Secure authentication for desktop software
* **Third-party Integrations** - Allow external services to access your APIs
* **Single Sign-On (SSO)** - Use WordPress as the identity provider
* **API Access Control** - Manage who can access your REST APIs
* **Plugin Development** - Add OAuth support to your WordPress plugins

= Security Features =

* **PKCE Required** - All authorization flows require PKCE for security
* **Token Rotation** - Refresh tokens rotate on each use
* **Secure Storage** - All secrets are properly hashed and encrypted
* **HTTPS Enforcement** - Required in production environments
* **Rate Limiting** - Protects against brute force attacks

= Developer Friendly =

OAuth Passport provides helper functions for easy integration:

* `oauth_passport_get_current_token()` - Get current OAuth token
* `oauth_passport_user_has_scope($scope)` - Check user permissions
* `oauth_passport_user_can($scope)` - Unified permission checking
* Complete REST API for client and token management

= Standards Compliance =

* RFC 6749 (OAuth 2.0)
* RFC 7636 (PKCE)
* RFC 7591 (Dynamic Client Registration)
* RFC 8414 (Authorization Server Metadata)
* OAuth 2.1 Draft Specification

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/oauth-passport/` or install through WordPress admin
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen
3. Navigate to **Settings > OAuth Passport** to configure
4. Register your first OAuth client to get started

= Manual Installation =

1. Download the plugin zip file
2. Extract and upload the `oauth-passport` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
3. Activate through WordPress admin
4. Configure in **Settings > OAuth Passport**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is OAuth 2.1? =

OAuth 2.1 is the latest version of the OAuth authorization framework. It consolidates security best practices and makes PKCE mandatory for all clients, providing enhanced security over OAuth 2.0.

= Do I need HTTPS? =

Yes, HTTPS is required in production environments for security. OAuth Passport enforces this requirement unless you're in a development environment.

= Can I use this with mobile apps? =

Absolutely! OAuth Passport is perfect for mobile app authentication. It supports PKCE which is essential for secure mobile OAuth flows.

= How do I register OAuth clients? =

You can register clients in two ways:
1. Through the WordPress admin interface (**Settings > OAuth Passport > OAuth Clients**)
2. Via the REST API using dynamic client registration

= What databases are supported? =

OAuth Passport supports MySQL 5.7+, MariaDB 10.3+, and SQLite (with WordPress SQLite integration plugin).

= Can I customize the available scopes? =

Yes! Use the `oauth_passport_scopes` filter to add custom scopes:

`add_filter('oauth_passport_scopes', function($scopes) {
    $scopes['custom'] = 'Custom permission description';
    return $scopes;
});`

== Screenshots ==

2. **Client Management** - Register and manage OAuth client applications
3. **Token Monitoring** - View and revoke active OAuth tokens
4. **Authorization Screen** - User-friendly consent interface
